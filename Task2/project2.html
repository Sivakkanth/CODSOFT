        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>JobGods is an innovative mobile application designed to bridge the gap between job seekers and potential employers. This essential tool in the job market simplifies the process of finding employment opportunities and managing job applications, offering a seamless experience across various devices.
            <br><br>In this project, I played a dual role as both a Front End Developer and a UI/UX Designer. Utilizing Flutter, a powerful framework for cross-platform mobile development, I crafted a responsive and visually appealing user interface. This approach ensures a seamless experience for users on both Android and iOS devices.
            <br><br>For back-end services, we leveraged Firebase, integrating its robust cloud-based solutions to enhance the app's functionality. Specifically, I implemented Firestore for the database, enabling efficient data storage and retrieval. Additionally, Firebase Authentication services were utilized to manage user login and security features, including password resets via OTP.
